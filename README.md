# Task-3
I recently completed a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game as part of my internship at #CODSOFT. This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my programming skills and apply key concepts in game development.
Building this game was a great learning experience, from designing the game logic to implementing player inputs and displaying results. Iâ€™m thrilled with how it turned out and look forward to tackling more challenges ahead!
